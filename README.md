# Leaving the Technical Coach Position

Given that most Technical Coaches are recent graduates of the full stack program, we expect most of you are looking for a full time position while you work as a Technical Coach. This is totally acceptable! If you need time off for interviews or to go to meet-ups, please make sure to schedule them in WhenIWork before next week's schedule is released. If the schedule is already set, feel free to drop or swap a shift, but remember: you are still responsible for it until someone takes it!

If you are looking to leave the position, there are a few things to please keep in mind:

## Two Weeks Notice

Like any other professional position, please give your Technical Coach Lead and Faculty Manager two weeks notice so we can plan accordingly with the schedule and ensure there are no gaps in coverage.

## References

Unfortunately, the Faculty Manager is unable to act as a professional reference because this is contract work and Technical Coaches are not employees of Flatiron. The Faculty Manager is able to confirm that you've worked in this role and the responsibilities that this role entails.
